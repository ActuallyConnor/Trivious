        <h1>Trivia API</h1>
        <a href="https://github.com/ActuallyConnor/Trivious" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>
        <a href="{{ url('/api') }}" target="_self">Documentation</a>
        <h2 style="">96,221 Questions</h2>
        <p>I started creating this trivia API when I decided to create a trivia slack app. At first I was leveraging a different API that contained only user submitted questions. The issue I found with it was it had only the option for true or false questions or multiple choice. I wanted something that was more of along the lines of single question and single answer. I didn't want the question not to work without the other multiple choice options.</p>
        <p>I began looking around for a different trivia api and came across <a href="http://jservice.io" target="_blank">jService.io</a>, a ruby based trivia API with 156,800 questions built by scraping jArchive. After poking around a little I discovered that it was being hosted on a simple heroku server with many outdated Ruby dependencies. I attempted to replicate the Ruby environment on my local machine and a simple Linode server with no success, even with rvm. I noticed the developer hasn't had much of an online presence in the last 5 years so after attempting to reach out with and receiving no response I decided to create my own trivia API.</p>
        <p>Upon noticing that jService kept track of questions marked as invalid and also had many questions with empty questions or answers fields. I built a quick PHP script and began scraping away. I then created another PHP script after evaluating the state of the database and cleaned up the invalid questions and sent it to a developer/mentor friend who was curious, <a href="http://jordanaharrison.com" target="_blank">Jordana Harrison</a>. They helped me do some further cleaning and created a new table that handled the relationships between the category names and the category IDs.</p>
        <p>Then I started to create the API with Laravel. I am a big fan of the open source movement so I didn't want to bog people down with having to use API keys, similar to the way jService works. The API is free and open to the public.</p>
